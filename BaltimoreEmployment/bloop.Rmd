## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
getwd()

top.employers <- read_excel('Data/top_employers.xlsx') %>%
    mutate(Rank = as.numeric(Rank),
           Company = as.character(Company),
           Employees = as.numeric(Employees),
           Industry = as.character(Industry))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
top.employers.new <- top.employers[which(top.employers$Rank > 5),]
ggplot(top.employers.new, aes(x=reorder(Company, Employees), y=Employees)) + 
                geom_bar(stat='identity') + coord_flip() + labs(x='') + 
                ggtitle('Top Private Sector Employers')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
